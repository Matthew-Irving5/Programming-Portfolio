# Programming Portfolio

Welcome!  
This repo showcases a selection of projects I’ve built to sharpen my software engineering skills and demonstrate my ability to deliver real-world, practical solutions.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Task Manager Website
A task management platform designed to help teams and individuals organize work efficiently.  
Create, Assign and organise tasks as you wish with this role-based task manager.

https://github.com/Matthew-Irving5/task-manager-saas

**Key Features**
- User authentication & role-based access (secure login & team management)
- CRUD functionality for tasks (create, update, delete, assign)
- Deadlines & priority levels for task tracking
- Responsive UI for mobile & desktop use
- Multi-user support (simulating SaaS scalability)

**Why I Built This**
I wanted to understand how SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) products are structured and what it takes to build something people could “use out of the box.”  
This project taught me:
- How to design for scalability (multi-user data separation)
- The importance of clean, intuitive UI for user retention
- Authentication flows and security best practices

### 2. Salary Predictor (Machine Learning)
A data-driven app that predicts salary ranges based on input factors like location, experience, and job role.

https://github.com/Matthew-Irving5/AI-Salary-Predictor

**Key Features**
- Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categories)
- Neural Network models for salary prediction
- Model evaluation & optimization
- User interface for inputs and real-time predictions

**Why I Built This**
I wanted hands-on experience applying machine learning to real-world datasets.  
This project taught me:
- The full ML pipeline (data → model → predictions)
- How to communicate model outputs to non-technical users
- The trade-offs between different ML approaches
